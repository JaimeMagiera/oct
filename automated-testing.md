# Implementing an Automated Testing Solution for OKD Installs

## Introduction 

Being a community project, OKD benefits greatly from from repeated testing of installation and functionality. In an effort to simplify the process of conducting repeated OKD installs on vSphere UPI, I developed a script that handles each step of the installation processâ€” from downloading the installer to cleaning up after the installer complete. The script is modular in the sense that each task is a separate function in the script. This allows youk to arrange tasks in different combinations by calling them in a wrapper script.
